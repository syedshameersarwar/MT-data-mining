abstract={Human cardiac organoids (hCOs), three-dimensional (3D) cellular constructs similar to in vivo organ, are new-generation models. To a large extent, a hCO retains the biological characteristics and functions of cells in vivo more accurately than previous models. With the continuous development of biotechnology, the hCO model is becoming increasingly complex and mature. High-fidelity hCOs help us better explore the mysteries of human physiology and integrate phenotypes with living functions into models. Here, we discuss recent advances in the methods of constructing human cardiac organoids and introduce applications of hCOs, especially in modeling cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, genetic cardiac diseases, and arrhythmia. In addition, we propose the prospects for and the limitations of hCOs. In conclusion, a greater understanding of hCOs will provide ways to improve hCO construction and make these models useful for future preclinical studies.},

abstract = {It is now well recognized that many lifesaving oncology drugs may adversely affect the heart and cardiovascular system, including causing irreversible cardiac injury that can result in reduced quality of life. These effects, which may manifest in the short term or long term, are mechanistically not well understood. Research is hampered by the reliance on whole-animal models of cardiotoxicity that may fail to reflect the fundamental biology or cardiotoxic responses of the human myocardium. The emergence of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes as an in vitro research tool holds great promise for understanding drug-induced cardiotoxicity of oncological drugs that may manifest as contractile and electrophysiological dysfunction, as well as structural abnormalities, making it possible to deliver novel drugs free from cardiac liabilities and guide personalized therapy. This article briefly reviews the challenges of cardio-oncology, the strengths and limitations of using human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes to represent clinical findings in the nonclinical research space, and future directions for their further use.}}

abstract = {When an action potential excites a fish cardiac myocyte it causes intracellular calcium (Ca) levels to rise initiating contraction. This sequence of events is termed ‘excitation–contraction coupling’. To end contraction and begin relaxation, Ca levels inside the myocyte must fall. This transient rise and fall of Ca with each contraction–relaxation cycle is called the ‘Ca transient’. A contraction–relaxation cycle is the cellular equivalent of the heartbeat. The rate and magnitude of the Ca transient determines the rate and strength of heart contraction. In fish, the Ca fluxes that generate this Ca transient can be of both extra- or intracellular origin and are regulated to adjust cardiac function in a response to a change in physiological demand.}

               causes of drug development failure and withdrawal from market.
               This study tested whether human induced pluripotent stem
               cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) combined with a
               low-impedance microelectrode array (MEA) system could improve on
               industry-standard preclinical cardiotoxicity screening methods,
               identify the effects of well-characterized drugs, and elucidate
               underlying risk factors for drug-induced arrhythmia. hiPSC-CMs
               may be advantageous over immortalized cell lines because they
               possess similar functional characteristics as primary human
               cardiomyocytes and can be generated in unlimited quantities.
               METHODS AND RESULTS: Pharmacological responses of beating
               embryoid bodies exposed to a comprehensive panel of drugs at 65
               to 95 days postinduction were determined. Responses of hiPSC-CMs
               to drugs were qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with
               the reported drug effects in literature. Torsadogenic hERG
               blockers, such as sotalol and quinidine, produced statistically
               and physiologically significant effects, consistent with
               patch-clamp studies, on human embryonic stem cell-derived
               cardiomyocytes hESC-CMs. False-negative and false-positive hERG
               blockers were identified accurately. Consistent with published
               studies using animal models, early afterdepolarizations and
               ectopic beats were observed in 33\% and 40\% of embryoid bodies
               treated with sotalol and quinidine, respectively, compared with
               negligible early afterdepolarizations and ectopic beats in
               untreated controls. CONCLUSIONS: We found that drug-induced
               arrhythmias can be recapitulated in hiPSC-CMs and documented
               with low impedance MEA. Our data indicate that the MEA/hiPSC-CM
               assay is a sensitive, robust, and efficient platform for testing
               drug effectiveness and for arrhythmia screening. This system may
               hold great potential for reducing drug development costs and may
               provide significant advantages over current industry standard
               assays that use immortalized cell lines or animal models.",

However{,} the current format of electrophysiological and contractile assessment of cardiomyocytes on a rigid substrate is not appropriate for cardiac tissues that beat dynamically. Here{,} we show a novel simultaneous measurement system for contractile force and extracellular field potential of iPS cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues using 500 nm-thick flexible electronic sheets. It was confirmed that the developed system is applicable for pharmacological studies and assessments of excitation–contraction coupling-related parameters{,} such as the electro-mechanical window. Our results indicate that flexible electronics with cardiac tissue engineering provide an advanced platform for drug development. This system will contribute to gaining new insight in pharmacological study of human cardiac function."}

abstract = {Summary Nested data structures are ubiquitous in the study of ecology and evolution, and such structures need to be modelled appropriately. Mixed-effects models offer a powerful framework to do so. Nested effects can usually be fitted using the syntax for crossed effects in mixed models, provided that the coding reflects implicit nesting. But the experimental design (either nested or crossed) affects the interpretation of the results. The key difference between nested and crossed effects in mixed models is the estimation and interpretation of the interaction variance. With nested data structures, the interaction variance is pooled with the main effect variance of the nested factor. Crossed designs are required to separate the two components. This difference between nested and crossed data is determined by the experimental design (thus by the nature of data sets) and not by the coding of the statistical model. Data can be nested by design in the sense that it would have been technically feasible and biologically relevant to collect the data in a crossed design. In such cases, the pooling of the variances needs to be clearly acknowledged. In other situations, it might be impractical or even irrelevant to apply a crossed design. We call such situations naturally nested, a case in which the pooling of the interaction variance will be less of an issue. The interpretation of results should reflect the fact that the interaction variance inflates the main effect variance when dealing with nested data structures. Whether or not this distinction is critical depends on the research question and the system under study. We present mixed models as a particularly useful tool for analysing nested designs, and we highlight the value of the estimated random variance as a quantity of biological interest. Important insights can be gained if random-effect variances are appropriately interpreted. We hope that our paper facilitates the transition from classical anovas to mixed models in dealing with categorical data.},
